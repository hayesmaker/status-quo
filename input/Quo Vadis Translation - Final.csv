sc002002_.SC,수도사4 : 슈라이더가 예언서를 입수했다는 것은 또하나의 불이 붙은 것을 의미하지만 현재는 당장 급한 불인 란포드경의 문제부터 해결해야 합니다.,,"Monks 4: The shoe that riders get the Prophets mean that another one of the non-attached, but is now an urgent need to address from now bulin ranpo de tribute issue.","Monks 4: The shoe that riders get the Prophets mean that another one of the non-attached, but is now an urgent need to address from now bulin ranpo de tribute issue."
sc002002_.SC,교황 : 음......,,Pope: Well ......,Pope: Well ......
sc002002_.SC,수도사1 : 그 말도 맞습니다. 하지만 란포드의 최종목표는 천년의 안식처입니다. 오히려 슈라이더가 또하나의 예언서를 가지고 있다는 것은 전화위복일 수도 있습니다.,,"Monk 1: That's right ridiculous.

sc002002_.SC,수도사3 : 이미 천년의 안식처로 들어갔을 지도 모를 란포드경의 흔적을 찾기보다 천년의 안식처로 란포드경을 추적해 들어가 제거하면 교황께서 우려하시는 모든 문제는 해결됩니다.,,"Monk 3: If you go to a track already one thousand years as a haven to ranpo map of De ranpo find traces of homage than one thousand years of Sir Roland, went home know who the pope had removed all the problems will be resolved concerns.","Monk 3: If you go to a track already one thousand years as a haven to ranpo map of De ranpo find traces of homage than one thousand years of Sir Roland, went home know who the pope had removed all the problems will be resolved concerns."
sc002002_.SC,수도사2 : 란포드경이 벌써 천년의 안식처로 들어 갔을 리는 만무합니다. 란포드경이 천년의 안식처로 들어갔는데도 슈라이더의 예언서를 찾지 못할 경우는 어떻게 대처한단 말입니까?,,"Monk 2: ranpo de Sir, you are already mu Lee went into the sanctuary of the millennium.

sc002002_.SC,수도사2 : 란포드경을 추격하여 제거한 후 슈라이더 문제를 처리해도 늦지 않다고 생각합니다. 슈라이더는 란포드경처럼 야망을 갖고 있지 않습니다.,,"Monk 2: Remove the chase ranpo Sir Roland, I do not think it too late to be treated the shoe rider problem.

sc002002_.SC,교황 : 이 부분은 결코 그냥 넘길 수 없는 부분이오. 수도사 1 의 말대로 란포드경의 최종목표는 천년의 안식처이오. 천년의 안식처에서 란포드는 더 이상 갈 곳도 없소.,,Pope: This section is part of Iwo never just can not pass.
